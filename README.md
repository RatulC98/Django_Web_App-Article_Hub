# Django_Web_App-Article_Hub

Article Hub is a full featured social media article sharing website where you
can read, write, share, comment and review various articles. Users can create and edit
their profiles. I also implemented a password reset via email feature. It uses Python Django
on the backend and HTML, CSS, Bootstrap on the frontend.
